                Koalas are not bears. They are not placental or 'eutherian' mammals, but MARSUPIALS, which means that their young are born
                immature and they develop further in the safety of a pouch. It’s incorrect to call them ‘Koala bears' - their correct name
                is simply 'Koalas'
            </p>

                There is a myth that Koalas sleep a lot because they ‘get drunk’ on gumleaves. Fortunately, this is not correct! Most of
                their time is spent sleeping because it requires a lot of energy to digest their toxic, fibrous, low-nutrition diet and sleeping
                is the best way to conserve energy.
